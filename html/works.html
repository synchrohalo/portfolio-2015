				<p class="small-description">Android mobile app via Adobe PhoneGap</p>
			
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Background</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">The Design Thinking mobile app was one of the projects commissioned for the UC Davis Computer Science/Computer Science & Engineering department’s senior design project course. My team's progress was overseen by the client, Helen Liang, CEO of startup UstartX Inc. based in Menlo Park, CA.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">To create a mobile app that assists a user in solving a problem by taking him/her/them through the design thinking process and recording the progress made at each step.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<!-- process -->
		<div class="row">
			<h5 class="page-title sub-title">Process</h5>
			<div class="text-body">	  
				<p>The client wanted an mobile app that would facilitate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking" target="_blank">design thinking process</a> on-the-go. Working in a team of four, I took the reins on designing the app's interface and, together, we spent countless discussions on the overall user flow.</p> 
				
				<p>Perhaps the most challenging part of the project was figuring out how the app would work. I'd learned a little about the design thinking process in an introductory design course, but my teammates were completely new to the concept at the time. We struggled with grasping the importance of the process, as our first run-through of it (via Stanford d.school's <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/" target="_blank">crash course</a>) as a team had been a frustrating and stressful experience. Consequently, we failed to develop a useful and comprehensive user flow.</p>
				
				<p>Despite this setback, we pushed onward. One of our initial ideas was to make the app an all-encompassing design thinking “toolbox”. Each step of the design thinking process could be navigated using the color-coded tabs at the top: blue for <em>Empathy</em>, green for <em>Define</em>, yellow for <em>Ideate</em>, orange for <em>Prototype</em>, and red for <em>Test</em> (as inspired by Stanford d.school’s representation of the process).<p>

				<div class="caption">
					<p class="uppercase small-label"><strong>A Holistic Toolbox</strong></p>
					<p class="small-description">The iOS- and Instagram-inspired navigation bar would contain different utilities: camera, video camera, voice recorder, notepad, timer, and brainstorming tools, which would vary depending on the current design thinking step. The user would be able to use any of these at will—no constraints, just constantly accessible tools to meet the user’s current needs.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row">
			<div class="text-body">
				<p>Thankfully, the team's constant communication with Helen put us on the right track. After receiving her feedback on this design, we were able to better understand her vision for the app, which was a more heavily guided, step-by-step demonstration of the design thinking process. The app was intended to be beginner-friendly so that any user could learn how to find human-centered solutions for the problems surrounding them. Each individual use of the app (which would ideally be completed within an hour) would result in a prototype that aims to solve the problem at hand.</p>
				
				<p>Although the team had a negative first experience, we opted to model the app’s flow after Stanford d.school’s crash course. We believed that if we were to break everything down and explain each step carefully, this procedure would give users a good introduction to design thinking and would yield tangible results in a short amount of time.</p>
				
				<p>My design concept was to take the above procedure and let it play out like a game—I was thinking <em>WarioWare</em> or <em>Dumb Ways to Die</em>—in which players are subject to a series of “mini-games” that are to be completed within an allotted amount of time. The "mini-games", in this case, would be timed activities, such as sketching out ideas or brainstorming with a mind map.</p>

Every explanation was to be broken down to make it easier to digest the overwhelming amount of information provided.</p>

				<p>All throughout, the user would be prompted to take a picture of any notes, sketches, or prototypes to keep track of the progress made.</p>

				<p class="small-description">iOS & Android mobile app via PhoneGap on Ionic framework</p>
			
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Background</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">This mobile app was a project I worked on during my recent internship at UstartX Inc. I worked with two other interns who were in charge of the client- and server-side code.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">To create a mobile app that connects professionals on business travel with locals or with one another to help them feel a sense of belonging in a new environment.</p>
			</div>

				<p>By request of the client, the user would be able to network with other professionals through the app, schedule upcoming trips to meet people ahead of time, and set up meetings with others by proposing a date, time, and location. Post-meeting, the user would be prompted to rate the meeting experience to establish and reinforce user credibility.</p> 
				
				<p>My teammates and I decided to go with a Tinder-style UI as it has proved very effective in allowing users to quickly browse through profiles and choose whom to meet. Because the app requires a wider scope of functionality, we included a tabs bar to keep navigation more organized and consistent.<p>
			</div>	
			
			<div class="row">	
				<p>The user’s home page shows a list of upcoming trips with a user’s hometown pinned at the top. From there, the user can look through other user profiles and choose whom he/she/they want to meet. Two connected users become “friends,” and a chat automatically forms between them so they can get to know each other and discuss meeting places and times. On the Calendar page, users are able to view their upcoming meetings, accept or decline pending requests, and also schedule new meetings with friends.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<p>As the app’s target demographic is professionals, I tried to keep the style simple and thought a flat design would work best. However, I added dimensions when I saw fit. For instance, specific elements cast a shadow to simulate layers and to render them more visible when overlaid on a background.</p>

				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Background</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">I attended <a href="https://www.treehacks.com/" target="_blank">TreeHacks</a> back in February of 2015 with two friends of mine, and we decided to use the time to learn new technologies. Based on the growing need for food delivery services by fellow Davis students, we created a web app that addresses the problem by facilitating the marketplace for this need.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">To create a web app that establishes an organized marketplace for food delivery services within the Davis community.</p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- process -->
			<div class="row">
				<h5 class="page-title sub-title">Process</h5>
			  
				<p>A couple of weeks before the hackathon, one of my teammates had created a Facebook group called <em>UC Davis Food Deliveries</em>. Unlike Bay Area cities, Davis was quite small and didn't have any professional services of the kind. Unexpectedly, the group exploded—it had gained hundreds of new members within a week and from then on saw multitudes of new posts daily.</p>
				
				<p>It was then that we realized the demand for food delivery services amongst students. Many, without any means of transportation in the wee hours of night, have no way of getting food on their own. For others, it's an issue of limited time and a busy schedule.</p>
				
				<p>We spent a better part of the first day discussing the scope of the project and what we wanted to accomplish. After going through various ideas, including GPS tracking and chat functionality, we ended up settling for a simple form-submission to ensure completion. After all, my teammates needed to spend some time learning the <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN Stack.</a></p>
				
				<p>I was left in charge of the website's visual design, and, also curious to learn something new, I used the Foundation framework for the first time. The framework was pretty painless to use, and I enjoyed customizing the look of our page.</p>
				
				<p>Most of my time was spent creating graphics. After deciding on the project name <em>MunchBusters</em>, I wanted the webpage to visually pack the same punch as its namesake. I went with a primary triadic color scheme, with red and yellow as the emphasis for an appetizing palette. All three colors are also commonly used in superhero costumes, and so I created a fun superhero mascot, the MunchBuster himself, to make the site feel more warm and engaging.</p>

				<p class="small-description">The <a href="http://daviscsclub.org/" target="_blank">Davis Computer Science Club</a> (DCSC) is an organization at UC Davis dedicated to serving CS students or those interested in the field. I was elected to be Marketing Director for the 2014-2015 school year, my responsibility mainly being to oversee the creation and distribution of marketing materials.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>

			<div class="text-body">	  
				<p>Although not formally a project, my role as Marketing Director with the Davis Computer Science Club was a year-long commitment that helped me grow as a designer and as a person.</p>
				
				<p>Prior to my incumbency, my leadership skills were pretty much non-existent. Even at the beginning, I struggled to speak up during meetings because I was too shy and felt like I had nothing to contribute. I took the position primarily because of my interest in graphic design and concentrated mostly on that.</p>
				
				<p>With a desire for change (and a little coaxing from the President), I decided to step up and be more involved in my role. I proposed and planned a club t-shirt design contest and successfully ran a <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> tournament in coordination with the quasi-<em>Melee</em>-club on campus. Together with two other officers, I organized a <em>Gender Diversity in Technology</em> event. I also took charge of generating club funds for the year.</p>
				
				<p>Along with my personal growth, I tried to push myself to be a better designer as well. I began spending more and more time on each banner, not limiting myself to only typography and colors, and added a focus on illustration. The following banners are my favorites among the bunch.</p>

					<p class="small-description">I made this during winter break, and, because I had more time on my hands, I went for a more illustration-heavy banner.

This event was entitled <em>Development Hub</em>, or <em>Dev Hub</em>, for short. At the suggestion of a friend, I used a rocket ship to represent the idea of a launch pad, or, figuratively speaking, a good place to begin a new undertaking.</p>

				<p>A going-away present for a dear person who is a huge fan of the <em>Zelda</em> series. I illustrated the two of us wearing "modern-day" Link- and Zelda-inspired clothing based on outfits we own.</p>
				
				<p>Hello, friend, wherever you are! I hope you're doing well. &#9786;</p>

			<h6>Illustrator & Photoshop</h6>
			
			<div class="desc-text">
				<p>Made for a special someone's birthday. We both love <em>Adventure Time</em>, and so I wanted to create a fan piece for him.</p>
			
				<p>The Lich has arguably some of the best lines in the series (and in all of television, probably), and these in particular stood out to me: both powerful and utterly chilling.</p>
			
				<p>If you don't already watch <em>Adventure Time</em>, I highly recommend you do so! There's a lot to appreciate beyond its childlike exterior.</p>

			<h6>Paint Tool SAI</h6>

			<div class="desc-text">
				<p>A pseudo-self-portrait. In middle school and high school, I wore a lot of scarves, no matter the weather conditions. My family friends used to tease me and call me "Scarf Girl".</p>
			
				<p>I drew this around the time I was trying to establish a style for my illustrations. I really enjoy the simplicity and whimsy of children's book art, so I tried using a variety of bright colors and crayon outlines to give the image a feeling of playfulness.</p>

			<h6>Paint Tool SAI</h6>

				<p>Another attempt to establish my illustration style. I played around with colors more but wanted to simplify details.</p>

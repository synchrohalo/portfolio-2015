			<p class="small-description">Android mobile app via Adobe PhoneGap</p>
		
			<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Background</strong></p>
			<p class="small-description">This mobile app was commissioned by Helen Liang of UstartX Inc. for the Computer Science/Computer Science & Engineering department’s senior design project course.</p>
			
			<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>
			<p class="small-description">To create a mobile app that simulates the quick-thinking and intuitive nature of the design thinking process and records a user’s progress with each step.</p>
		</div>
		
		<!--<div class="row line-break"></div>-->
		
		<div class="row">
			<h5 class="page-title sub-title">Process</h5>
		  
			<p>The client, Helen Liang, wanted an app that would facilitate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking" target="_blank">design thinking process</a> on-the-go. Working in a team of four, I took the reins on designing the interface.</p> 
			
			<p>My initial idea was to make the app an all-encompassing design thinking “toolbox”. Each step of the design thinking process could be navigated using the color-coded tabs at the top: blue for <em>Empathy</em>, green for <em>Define</em>, yellow for <em>Ideate</em>, orange for <em>Prototype</em>, and red for <em>Test</em> (as inspired by Stanford d.school’s representation of the process).<p>
		</div>	
	    
		<div class="row project-img">
			<img class="mobile-img" src="../images/design-thinking/initial-1.gif" />
			
			<div class="caption">
				<p class="uppercase small-label"><strong>A Holistic Toolbox</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">The iOS- and Instagram-inspired navigation bar would contain different utilities: camera, video camera, voice recorder, notepad, timer, and brainstorming tools, which would vary depending on the current tab, or step, of the process. The user would be able to use any of these at will—no constraints, just constantly accessible tools to meet the user’s current needs.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row">
			<p>After getting feedback on this design, we learned that our client had wanted a more heavily guided, step-by-step demonstration of the process. Basically, each use of the app (which would ideally be completed within an hour) should result in a prototype that aims to solve a problem concerning the topic of interest.</p>
			
			<p>We then opted to model the app’s flow after Stanford d.school’s <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/" target="_blank">crash course</a>. Both beginner-friendly and fast-paced, this procedure would give users a good introduction to design thinking and would yield tangible results in a short amount of time.</p>
			
			<p>My design concept was to take the above procedure and let it play out like a game—I was thinking <em>WarioWare</em> or <em>Dumb Ways to Die</em>—in which players were subject to a series of “mini-games” that were to be completed within an allotted amount of time.</p>

			<div class="caption">
				<p class="uppercase small-label"><strong>Fast-Paced Fun</strong><p>
				<p class="small-description">In the same vein as the aforementioned games, the app would take the user through sub-steps of the design thinking process, each with a specific goal and with a time limit to keep the user’s ideas as visceral as possible.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row">	
			<p>We would limit the amount of text displayed on each page and use overlays to provide additional information. We wanted goals to be the focus of the page, when applicable, and every explanation to be broken down to make it easier to digest the overwhelming amount of information provided.</p>
			
			<p>All throughout, the user would be prompted to take a picture of any notes, sketches, or prototypes to keep track of the progress made.</p>

				<p class="small-description">The mascot, whom we call Dennis the dinosaur, was created at our client’s request to give the app a more “human” feel, with the character accompanying the user at each step. We also wanted to emphasize that the Design Thinking process should be a fun and creative way to solve problems.</p>

				<p class="small-description">iOS & Android mobile app via PhoneGap on Ionic framework</p>
			
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Background</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">This app was a project during my recent internship at UstartX Inc. My team consisted of me and two others who worked on both the back-end and client code.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">To create a mobile app that connects professionals on business travel with locals or with one another to help them feel a sense of belonging in a new environment.</p>

				<p>By request of the client, the user would be able to network with other professionals through the app, schedule upcoming trips to meet people ahead of time, and set up meetings with one another by proposing a date, time, and location. Post-meeting, the user would be prompted to rate the meeting experience with the other user to establish and reinforce user credibility.</p> 
				
				<p>My teammates and I decided to go with a Tinder-style UI as it has proved very effective in allowing users to browse through profiles and network with desired people. Because of the wider scope of functionalities, we included a tabs bar to keep navigation more organized and consistent.<p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="row">	
				<p>The user’s home page shows a list of upcoming trips and a user’s hometown pinned at the top. From there, the user can look through other user profiles and choose whom he/she/they want to meet. Two connected users become “friends,” and a chat automatically forms between them so they can get to know each other and discuss meeting places and times. On the Calendar page, users are able to view their upcoming meetings, accept or decline pending requests, and also schedule new meetings with friends.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<p>As the app’s target demographic is professionals, I tried to keep the app’s style simple and thought a flat design would work best. However, I added dimensions when I saw fit, such as giving certain elements shadow effect to simulate layers and for emphasis.</p>

				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Background</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">I attended <a href="https://www.treehacks.com/" target="_blank">TreeHacks</a> back in February of 2015 with two friends of mine, and we decided to use the time to learn new technologies. Based on the growing need for food delivery services for fellow UC Davis students, we created a web app that addresses the problem by facilitating the marketplace for this need.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="uppercase small-label">Goal</strong></p>
				<p class="small-description">To create a web app that establishes an organized marketplace for food delivery services within the Davis community.</p>
			</div>
			
			<!--<div class="row line-break"></div>-->
			
			<div class="row">
				<h5 class="page-title sub-title">Process</h5>
			  
				<p>A couple of weeks before the hackathon, one of my teammates had created a Facebook group for UC Davis Food Deliveries. Unlike Bay Area cities, Davis was quite small and didn't have any professional services of the kind. Unexpectedly, the group exploded—it had gained hundreds of new members within a week and from then on saw multitudes of new posts daily.</p>
				
				<p>It was then that we realized the demand for food delivery services amongst students. Many, without any means of transportation in the wee hours of night, have no way of getting food on their own. For others, it's an issue of limited time and a busy schedule.</p>
				
				<p>We spent a better part of the evening of the first day discussing the scope of the project and what we wanted to accomplish. After going through various ideas, including GPS tracking and chat functionality, we ended up settling for a simple form-submission as my teammates began learning the <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN Stack.</a></p>
				
				<p>I was left in charge of the website's visual design, and, also curious to learn something new, I used the Foundation framework for the first time. The framework was pretty painless to use, and I enjoyed customizing the look of our page.</p>
				
				<p>Most of my time was spent creating graphics. After deciding on the project name <em>MunchBusters</em>, I wanted the webpage to visually pack the same punch as its namesake. I went with a primary triadic color scheme, with red and yellow as the emphasis for an appetizing palette. All three colors are also commonly used in superhero costumes, and so I created a fun superhero mascot, the MunchBuster himself, to make the webpage feel more warm and engaging.</p>

				<p>Drained from the sleepless night and (relatively) immense use of brain power, we were unable to achieve all that we set out to do. However, my teammates and I had a lot of fun in the process and were proud to show off what we ended up with!</p>
